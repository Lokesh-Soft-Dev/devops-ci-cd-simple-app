Title: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions & Docker
Name: Lokesh (or your name)
Date: <date>

Abstract:
Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that runs tests, builds a Docker image, pushes to Docker Hub, and deploys the image locally via Docker (or Minikube). This demonstrates automated build and deployment without cloud services.

Tools:
GitHub Actions, Docker, Docker Hub, Node.js, (Minikube optional), Git

Implementation:
1. Application: simple Node.js app with `/`, `/health`, and `/metrics`.
2. Dockerfile: containerizes the app (node:18-alpine base).
3. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`):
   - build-test job: checkout, npm install, npm test
   - build-and-push job: login to Docker Hub (secrets), build and push image via docker/build-push-action
4. Local deployment: `docker run -p 5000:3000 <username>/simple-app:latest` (or Kubernetes manifests in `k8s/` for Minikube).

Results:
- GitHub Actions run: <paste Actions run URL>
- Docker Hub repository: https://hub.docker.com/r/<your-username>/simple-app
- Local verification: `curl http://localhost:5000/` returned: "<paste output>"

Conclusion:
The pipeline reliably runs tests, builds images, and publishes them. Next steps could include automated deployments to a Kubernetes cluster, adding Prometheus/Grafana for observability, and more robust testing.
